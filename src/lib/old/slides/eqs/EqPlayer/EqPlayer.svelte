  This is Just a go-through component just for currentTime to change items.
  - There should not be currentTime inside any Player since the Player has to do nothing with time , another layer/function should edit the data and player should just play it.
  - the player will have setCurrentTime (old set pulse) to set time at run time (in player)
  - Editor will need currentTime (from sound file) to sync animation with it.
  - Acrually player and editor both need currentTime but in player it does not go to player-core where as in editor it can go a bit deep ??
  - do not move currentTime to store since i do not want to share in across.
